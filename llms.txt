# **nflfastR**

`nflfastR` is a set of functions to efficiently scrape NFL play-by-play
data. `nflfastR` expands upon the features of nflscrapR:

- The package contains NFL play-by-play data back to 1999
- As suggested by the package name, it obtains games **much** faster
- Includes completion probability (`cp`), completion percentage over
  expected (`cpoe`), and expected yards after the catch (`xyac_epa` and
  `xyac_mean_yardage`) in play-by-play going back to 2006
- Includes drive information, including drive starting position and
  drive result
- Includes series information, including series number and series
  success
- Hosts [a release of play-by-play data going back to
  1999](https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases/tag/pbp) for
  very quick access
- Features models for Expected Points, Win Probability, Completion
  Probability, and Yards After the Catch (see section below)
- Includes a function
  [`update_db()`](https://nflfastr.com/reference/update_db.md) that
  creates and updates a database

We owe a debt of gratitude to the original
[`nflscrapR`](https://github.com/maksimhorowitz/nflscrapR) team, Maksim
Horowitz, Ronald Yurko, and Samuel Ventura, without whose contributions
and inspiration this package would not exist.

## Installation

The easiest way to get nflfastR is to install it from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=nflfastR) with:

``` r
install.packages("nflfastR")
```

To get a bug fix or to use a feature from the development version, you
can install the development version of nflfastR either from
[GitHub](https://github.com/nflverse/nflfastR/) with:

``` r
if (!require("pak")) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("nflverse/nflfastR")
```

or prebuilt from the [development repo](https://nflverse.r-universe.dev)
with:

``` r
install.packages("nflfastR", repos = c("https://nflverse.r-universe.dev", getOption("repos")))
```

## Usage

We have provided some application examples in the **[Getting
Started](https://nflfastr.com/articles/nflfastR.html)** article.
However, these require a basic knowledge of R. For this reason we have
the **[nflfastR beginner’s
guide](https://nflfastr.com/articles/beginners_guide.html)**, which we
recommend to all those who are looking for an introduction to nflfastR
with R.

You can find column names and descriptions in the **[Field
Descriptions](https://nflfastr.com/articles/field_descriptions.html)**
article, or by accessing the `field_descriptions` dataframe from the
package.

## Data access

Even though `nflfastR` is very fast, **we recommend downloading the data
from [here](https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases/tag/pbp)
or using the `nflreadr` package**. These data sets include play-by-play
data of complete seasons going back to 1999 and are updated nightly
during the season. The files contain both regular season and postseason
data, and one can use game_type or week to figure out which games
occurred in the postseason.

## nflfastR models

`nflfastR` uses its own models for Expected Points, Win Probability,
Completion Probability, and Expected Yards After the Catch. To read
about the models, please see [this post on Open Source
Football](https://opensourcefootball.com/posts/2020-09-28-nflfastr-ep-wp-and-cp-models/).
For a more detailed description of the motivation for Expected Points
models, we highly recommend this paper [from the nflscrapR team located
here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.00998).

Here is a visualization of the Expected Points model by down and
yardline.

Here is a visualization of the Completion Probability model by air yards
and pass direction.

`nflfastR` includes two win probability models: one with and one without
incorporating the pre-game spread.

## Special thanks

- To Nick Shoemaker for [finding and making available JSON-formatted NFL
  play-by-play back to 1999](https://github.com/CroppedClamp/nfl_pbps)
  (`nflfastR` uses this source for 1999 and 2000 and previously also
  used it for 2001-2010)
- To Lau Sze Yui for developing a scraping function to access
  JSON-formatted NFL play-by-play beginning in 2001
- To Aaron Schatz and FTN Fantasy for providing charting data to
  correctly mark scrambles in the 1999-2005 seasons
- To Lee Sharpe for curating a resource for game information
- To Timo Riske, Lau Sze Yui, Sean Clement, and Daniel Houston for many
  helpful discussions regarding the development of the new `nflfastR`
  models
- To Zach Feldman and Josh Hermsmeyer for many helpful discussions about
  CPOE models as well as Peter Owen for many helpful suggestions for the
  CP model
- To Florian Schmitt for the logo design
- The many users who found and reported bugs in `nflfastR` 1.0
- And of course, the original
  [`nflscrapR`](https://github.com/maksimhorowitz/nflscrapR) team,
  Maksim Horowitz, Ronald Yurko, and Samuel Ventura, whose work
  represented a dramatic step forward for the state of public NFL
  research
