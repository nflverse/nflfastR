# Compute expected points

for provided plays. Returns the data with probabilities of each scoring
event and EP added. The following columns must be present: season,
home_team, posteam, roof (coded as 'open', 'closed', or 'retractable'),
half_seconds_remaining, yardline_100, ydstogo,
posteam_timeouts_remaining, defteam_timeouts_remaining

## Usage

``` r
calculate_expected_points(pbp_data)
```

## Arguments

- pbp_data:

  Play-by-play dataset to estimate expected points for.

## Value

The original pbp_data with the following columns appended to it:

- ep:

  expected points.

- no_score_prob:

  probability of no more scoring this half.

- opp_fg_prob:

  probability next score opponent field goal this half.

- opp_safety_prob:

  probability next score opponent safety this half.

- opp_td_prob:

  probability of next score opponent touchdown this half.

- fg_prob:

  probability next score field goal this half.

- safety_prob:

  probability next score safety this half.

- td_prob:

  probability text score touchdown this half.

## Details

Computes expected points for provided plays. Returns the data with
probabilities of each scoring event and EP added. The following columns
must be present:

- season

- home_team

- posteam

- roof (coded as 'outdoors', 'dome', or 'open'/'closed'/NA
  (retractable))

- half_seconds_remaining

- yardline_100

- down

- ydstogo

- posteam_timeouts_remaining

- defteam_timeouts_remaining

## Examples

``` r
# \donttest{
try({# to avoid CRAN test problems
library(dplyr)

"half_seconds_remaining" = 1800,
"yardline_100" = c(rep(80, 17), rep(75, 4)),
"down" = 1,
"ydstogo" = 10,
"posteam_timeouts_remaining" = 3,
"defteam_timeouts_remaining" = 3
)
