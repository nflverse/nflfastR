# Get NFL Play by Play Data

Load and parse NFL play-by-play data and add all of the original
nflfastR variables. As nflfastR now provides multiple functions which
add information to the output of this function, it is recommended to use
[`build_nflfastR_pbp`](https://nflfastr.com/reference/build_nflfastR_pbp.md)
instead.

## Usage

``` r
fast_scraper(
  game_ids,
  dir = getOption("nflfastR.raw_directory", default = NULL),
  ...,
  in_builder = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- game_ids:

  Vector of character ids or a data frame including the variable
  `game_id` (see details for further information).

- dir:

  Path to local directory (defaults to option "nflfastR.raw_directory")
  where nflfastR searches for raw game play-by-play data. See
  [`save_raw_pbp()`](https://nflfastr.com/reference/save_raw_pbp.md) for
  additional information.

- ...:

  Additional arguments passed to the scraping functions (for internal
  use)

- in_builder:

  If `TRUE`, the final message will be suppressed (for usage inside of
  [`build_nflfastR_pbp`](https://nflfastr.com/reference/build_nflfastR_pbp.md)).
