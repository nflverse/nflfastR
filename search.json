Let’s make sure worked: HOU 3 fewer seasons didn’t exist 1999 2001, fine, team names number seasons . Okay NOW can join: Now ’re getting really close want! Next need create new columns prior year EPA, let’s point differential . Finally! Now data place can start things .","code":"team_wins |>   group_by(team) |>   summarize(n=n()) |>   arrange(n) #> # A tibble: 35 × 2 #>    team      n #>    <chr> <int> #>  1 LV        6 #>  2 LAC       9 #>  3 LA       10 #>  4 STL      17 #>  5 SD       18 #>  6 OAK      21 #>  7 HOU      24 #>  8 ARI      27 #>  9 ATL      27 #> 10 BAL      27 #> # ℹ 25 more rows team_wins <- team_wins |>   mutate(     team = case_when(       team == 'OAK' ~ 'LV',       team == 'SD' ~ 'LAC',       team == 'STL' ~ 'LA',       TRUE ~ team     )   ) team_wins |>   group_by(team) |>   summarize(n=n()) |>   arrange(n) #> # A tibble: 32 × 2 #>    team      n #>    <chr> <int> #>  1 HOU      24 #>  2 ARI      27 #>  3 ATL      27 #>  4 BAL      27 #>  5 BUF      27 #>  6 CAR      27 #>  7 CHI      27 #>  8 CIN      27 #>  9 CLE      27 #> 10 DAL      27 #> # ℹ 22 more rows data <- team_wins |>   left_join(offense, by = c('team' = 'posteam', 'season')) |>   left_join(defense, by = c('team' = 'defteam', 'season'))  data |>   filter(team == 'SEA' & season >= 2012) #> # A tibble: 14 × 8 #>    team  season  wins point_diff off_rush_epa off_pass_epa def_rush_epa #>    <chr>  <int> <dbl>      <int>        <dbl>        <dbl>        <dbl> #>  1 SEA     2012  11          167     -0.00476       0.213       -0.0738 #>  2 SEA     2013  13          186     -0.101         0.188       -0.128  #>  3 SEA     2014  12          140      0.0295        0.139       -0.231  #>  4 SEA     2015  10          146     -0.104         0.249       -0.148  #>  5 SEA     2016  10.5         62     -0.126         0.102       -0.207  #>  6 SEA     2017   9           34     -0.192         0.0584      -0.122  #>  7 SEA     2018  10           81     -0.0273        0.210       -0.130  #>  8 SEA     2019  11            7     -0.136         0.119       -0.0930 #>  9 SEA     2020  12           88     NA            NA           NA      #> 10 SEA     2021   7           29     NA            NA           NA      #> 11 SEA     2022   9            6     NA            NA           NA      #> 12 SEA     2023   9          -38     NA            NA           NA      #> 13 SEA     2024  10            7     NA            NA           NA      #> 14 SEA     2025  NA           NA     NA            NA           NA      #> # ℹ 1 more variable: def_pass_epa <dbl> data <- data |>    arrange(team, season) |>   group_by(team) |>    mutate(     prior_off_rush_epa = lag(off_rush_epa),     prior_off_pass_epa = lag(off_pass_epa),     prior_def_rush_epa = lag(def_rush_epa),     prior_def_pass_epa = lag(def_pass_epa),     prior_point_diff = lag(point_diff)   ) |>    ungroup()  data |>   head(5) #> # A tibble: 5 × 13 #>   team  season  wins point_diff off_rush_epa off_pass_epa def_rush_epa #>   <chr>  <int> <dbl>      <int>        <dbl>        <dbl>        <dbl> #> 1 ARI     1999     6       -137       -0.226      -0.150       -0.0335 #> 2 ARI     2000     3       -233       -0.247      -0.0696       0.0157 #> 3 ARI     2001     7        -48       -0.179       0.0727      -0.0771 #> 4 ARI     2002     5       -155       -0.160      -0.0517      -0.0175 #> 5 ARI     2003     4       -227       -0.234      -0.112       -0.0890 #> # ℹ 6 more variables: def_pass_epa <dbl>, prior_off_rush_epa <dbl>, #> #   prior_off_pass_epa <dbl>, prior_def_rush_epa <dbl>, #> #   prior_def_pass_epa <dbl>, prior_point_diff <int>"},{"path":"https://www.nflfastr.com/articles/beginners_guide.html","id":"correlations-and-regressions","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"Real life example: let’s make a win total model","what":"Correlations and regressions","title":"A beginner's guide to nflfastR","text":"’ve covered select, see new use minus sign de-selects variables (need de-select team name correlation work doesn’t work character strings, correlation season number meaningless). ’ve run correlation dataframe, removing missing values, rounding 2 digits. surprisingly, see wins current season strongly related passing offense EPA rushing EPA defense EPA, prior offense carries predictive power prior defense. Pass offense stable year year (0.46) rush offense (0.32), pass defense (0.27), rush defense (0.27). ’m actually surprised values passing offense aren’t higher relative others. Maybe prior results come nflscrapR era (2009 - 2019)? Let’s check looks like since 2009 relative earlier seasons: Yep, seems case. recent period, passing offense become slightly stable predictive following-year success, time rushing offense become substantially less stable less predictive future team success. Now let’s basic regression wins prior offense defense EPA/play. Maybe look recent period fit model since ’s relevant 2020. real world, rigorous making decisions like , let’s proceed anyway. ’m actually pretty surprised passing offense isn’t higher . compare simply using point differential?
