\usage{
calculate_player_stats(pbp, weekly = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pbp}{A Data frame of NFL play-by-play data typically loaded with
\code{\link[=load_pbp]{load_pbp()}} or \code{\link[=build_nflfastR_pbp]{build_nflfastR_pbp()}}. If the data doesn't include the variable
\code{qb_epa}, the function \code{add_qb_epa()} will be called to add it.}

\item{weekly}{If \code{TRUE}, returns week-by-week stats, otherwise, stats
for the entire Data frame.}
}
\value{
A data frame including the following columns (all ID columns are
decoded to the gsis ID format):
\describe{

\item{recent_team}{Most recent team player appears in \code{pbp} with.}
\item{season}{Season if \code{weekly} is \code{TRUE}}
\item{week}{Week if \code{weekly} is \code{TRUE}}
\item{season_type}{\code{REG} or \code{POST} if \code{weekly} is \code{TRUE}}
\item{opponent_team}{The player's opponent team if \code{weekly} is \code{TRUE}}
\item{completions}{The number of completed passes.}
\item{attempts}{The number of pass attempts as defined by the NFL.}
\item{passing_yards}{Yards gained on pass plays.}
\item{passing_tds}{The number of passing touchdowns.}

\item{passing_air_yards}{Passing air yards (includes incomplete passes).}
\item{passing_yards_after_catch}{Yards after the catch gained on plays in
which player was the passer (this is an unofficial stat and may differ slightly
between different sources).}
\item{passing_first_downs}{First downs on pass attempts.}
\item{passing_epa}{Total expected points added on pass attempts and sacks.
NOTE: this uses the variable \code{qb_epa}, which gives QB credit for EPA for up
to the point where a receiver lost a fumble after a completed catch and makes
EPA work more like passing yards on plays with fumbles.}
\item{passing_2pt_conversions}{Two-point conversion passes.}
\item{pacr}{Passing Air Conversion Ratio. PACR = \code{passing_yards} / \code{passing_air_yards}}
\item{dakota}{Adjusted EPA + CPOE composite based on coefficients which best predict adjusted EPA/play in the following year.}
\item{carries}{The number of official rush attempts (incl. scrambles and kneel downs).
Rushes after a lateral reception don't count as carry.}
\item{rushing_yards}{Yards gained when rushing with the ball (incl. scrambles and kneel downs).
Also includes yards gained after obtaining a lateral on a play that started
with a rushing attempt.}
\item{rushing_tds}{The number of rushing touchdowns (incl. scrambles).
Also includes touchdowns after obtaining a lateral on a play that started
with a rushing attempt.}
\item{rushing_fumbles}{The number of rushes with a fumble.}

Also includes touchdowns after receiving a lateral on a play that started
as a pass play.}
\item{receiving_air_yards}{Receiving air yards (incl. incomplete passes).}
\item{receiving_yards_after_catch}{Yards after the catch gained on plays in
which player was receiver (this is an unofficial stat and may differ slightly
between different sources).}
\item{receiving_fumbles}{The number of fumbles after a pass reception.}
\item{receiving_fumbles_lost}{The number of fumbles lost after a pass reception.}

\item{air_yards_share}{The share of receiving_air_yards of the player in all air_yards of his team}

This function was deprecated because we have a new, much better and
harmonized approach in \code{\link[=calculate_stats]{calculate_stats()}}.

Build columns that aggregate official passing, rushing, and receiving stats
either at the game level or at the level of the entire data frame passed.
