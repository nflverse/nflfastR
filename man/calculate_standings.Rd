\title{Compute Division Standings and Conference Seeds from Play by Play}
\usage{
calculate_standings(
  nflverse_object,
  tiebreaker_depth = 3,
  playoff_seeds = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{nflverse_object}{Data object of class \code{nflverse_data}. Either schedules
as returned by \code{\link[=fast_scraper_schedules]{fast_scraper_schedules()}} or \code{\link[nflreadr:load_schedules]{nflreadr::load_schedules()}}.
Or play-by-play data as returned by \code{\link[=load_pbp]{load_pbp()}}, \code{\link[=build_nflfastR_pbp]{build_nflfastR_pbp()}}, or
\code{\link[=fast_scraper]{fast_scraper()}}.}

\item{tiebreaker_depth}{A single value equal to 1, 2, or 3. The default is 3. The
value controls the depth of tiebreakers that shall be applied. The deepest
currently implemented tiebreaker is strength of schedule. The following
values are valid:
\describe{
\item{tiebreaker_depth = 1}{Break all ties with a coinflip. Fastest variant.}
\item{tiebreaker_depth = 2}{Apply head-to-head and division win percentage tiebreakers. Random if still tied.}
\item{tiebreaker_depth = 3}{Apply all tiebreakers through strength of schedule. Random if still tied.}
}}

\item{playoff_seeds}{Number of playoff teams per conference. If \code{NULL} (the
default), the function will try to split \code{nflverse_object} into seasons prior
2020 (6 seeds) and 2020ff (7 seeds). If set to a numeric, it will be used
for all seasons in \code{nflverse_object}!}
}
\value{
A tibble with NFL regular season standings
}
\description{
\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#deprecated}{\figure{lifecycle-deprecated.svg}{options: alt='[Deprecated]'}}}{\strong{[Deprecated]}}

This function was deprecated and replaced by \code{\link[nflseedR:nfl_standings]{nflseedR::nfl_standings()}}.

This function calculates division standings as well as playoff
seeds per conference based on either nflverse play-by-play data or nflverse
schedule data.
