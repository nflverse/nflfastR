#'
#' @description
#' `r lifecycle::badge("deprecated")`
#'
#' This function was deprecated because we have a new, much better and
#' harmonized approach in [`calculate_stats()`].
#'
#' @param pbp A Data frame of NFL play-by-play data typically loaded with
#' [load_pbp()] or [build_nflfastR_pbp()]. If the data doesn't include the variable
#' `qb_epa`, the function `add_qb_epa()` will be called to add it.
#' @param weekly If `TRUE`, returns week-by-week stats, otherwise, stats
#' for the entire Data frame.
#' @description Build columns that aggregate official passing, rushing, and receiving stats
#' either at the game level or at the level of the entire data frame passed.
#' @return A data frame including the following columns (all ID columns are
#' decoded to the gsis ID format):
#' \describe{
#' \item{player_id}{ID of the player. Use this to join to other sources.}
#' \item{player_name}{Name of the player}
#' \item{player_display_name}{Full name of the player}
#' \item{position}{Position of the player}
#' \item{position_group}{Position group of the player}
#' \item{headshot_url}{URL to a player headshot image}
#' \item{games}{The number of games where the player recorded passing, rushing or receiving stats.}
#' \item{recent_team}{Most recent team player appears in `pbp` with.}
#' \item{season}{Season if `weekly` is `TRUE`}
#' \item{week}{Week if `weekly` is `TRUE`}
#' \item{season_type}{`REG` or `POST` if `weekly` is `TRUE`}
#' \item{opponent_team}{The player's opponent team if `weekly` is `TRUE`}
#' \item{completions}{The number of completed passes.}
#' \item{attempts}{The number of pass attempts as defined by the NFL.}
#' \item{passing_yards}{Yards gained on pass plays.}
#' \item{passing_tds}{The number of passing touchdowns.}
#' \item{interceptions}{The number of interceptions thrown.}
#' \item{sacks}{The Number of times sacked.}
#' \item{sack_yards}{Yards lost on sack plays.}
#' \item{sack_fumbles}{The number of sacks with a fumble.}
#' \item{sack_fumbles_lost}{The number of sacks with a lost fumble.}
#' \item{passing_air_yards}{Passing air yards (includes incomplete passes).}
#' \item{passing_yards_after_catch}{Yards after the catch gained on plays in
#' which player was the passer (this is an unofficial stat and may differ slightly
#' between different sources).}
#' \item{passing_first_downs}{First downs on pass attempts.}
#' \item{passing_epa}{Total expected points added on pass attempts and sacks.
#' NOTE: this uses the variable `qb_epa`, which gives QB credit for EPA for up
#' to the point where a receiver lost a fumble after a completed catch and makes
#' EPA work more like passing yards on plays with fumbles.}
#' \item{passing_2pt_conversions}{Two-point conversion passes.}
#' \item{pacr}{Passing Air Conversion Ratio. PACR = `passing_yards` / `passing_air_yards`}
#' \item{dakota}{Adjusted EPA + CPOE composite based on coefficients which best predict adjusted EPA/play in the following year.}
#' \item{carries}{The number of official rush attempts (incl. scrambles and kneel downs).
#' Rushes after a lateral reception don't count as carry.}
#' \item{rushing_yards}{Yards gained when rushing with the ball (incl. scrambles and kneel downs).
#' Also includes yards gained after obtaining a lateral on a play that started
#' with a rushing attempt.}
#' \item{rushing_tds}{The number of rushing touchdowns (incl. scrambles).
#' Also includes touchdowns after obtaining a lateral on a play that started
#' with a rushing attempt.}

#' gained after receiving a lateral on a play that started as a pass play.}
#' \item{receiving_tds}{The number of touchdowns following a pass reception.
#' Also includes touchdowns after receiving a lateral on a play that started
#' as a pass play.}
#' \item{receiving_air_yards}{Receiving air yards (incl. incomplete passes).}
