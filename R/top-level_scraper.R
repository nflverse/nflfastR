#' Get NFL Play by Play Data
#'
#' @description Load and parse NFL play-by-play data and add all of the original
#'   nflfastR variables. As nflfastR now provides multiple functions which add
#'   information to the output of this function, it is recommended to use
#'   \code{\link{build_nflfastR_pbp}} instead.
#'
#' @param game_ids Vector of character ids or a data frame including the variable
#' `game_id` (see details for further information).
#' @param dir Path to local directory (defaults to option "nflfastR.raw_directory")
#'   where nflfastR searches for raw game play-by-play data.
#'   See [save_raw_pbp()] for additional information.
#' @param ... Additional arguments passed to the scraping functions (for internal use)
#' @param in_builder If \code{TRUE}, the final message will be suppressed (for usage inside of \code{\link{build_nflfastR_pbp}}).
#' @details To load valid game_ids please use the package function
#' \code{\link{fast_scraper_schedules}} (the function can directly handle the
#' output of that function)
#' @seealso For information on parallel processing and progress updates please
#' see [nflfastR].
#' @seealso [build_nflfastR_pbp()], [save_raw_pbp()]
