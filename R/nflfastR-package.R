#' @details # Parallel Processing and Progress Updates in nflfastR
#'
#' ## Preface
#'
#' Prior to nflfastR v4.0, parallel processing could be activated with an
#' argument `pp` in the relevant functions and progress updates were always
#' shown. Both of these methods are bad practice and were therefore removed
#' in nflfastR v4.0
#'
#' The next sections describe how to make nflfastR work in parallel processes
#' and show progress updates if the user wants to.
#'
#' ## More Speed Using Parallel Processing
#'
#' Nearly all nflfastR functions support parallel processing
#' using [furrr::future_map()] if it is enabled by a call to [future::plan()]
#' prior to the function call.
#' Please see the documentation of the functions for detailed information.
#'
#' As an example, the following code block will resolve all function calls in the
#' current session using multiple sessions in the background and load play-by-play
#' data for the 2018 through 2020 seasons or build them freshly for the 2018 and
#' 2019 Super Bowls:
#' ```
#' future::plan("multisession")
#' load_pbp(2018:2020)
#' build_nflfastR_pbp(c("2018_21_NE_LA", "2019_21_SF_KC"))
#' ```
#' We recommend choosing a default parallel processing method and saving it
#' as an environment variable in the R user profile to make sure all futures
#' will be resolved with the chosen method by default.
#' This can be done by following the below given steps.
#'
#' First, run the following line and the file `.Renviron` should be opened automatically.
#' If you haven't saved any environment variables yet, this will be an empty file.
#' ```
#' usethis::edit_r_environ()
#'```
#' In the opened file `.Renviron` add the next line, then save the file and restart your R session.
#' Please note that this example sets "multisession" as default. For most users
#' this should be the appropriate plan but please make sure it truly is.
#' ```
#' R_FUTURE_PLAN="multisession"
#' ```
#' After the session is freshly restarted please check if the above method worked
#' by running the next line. If the output is `FALSE` you successfully set up a
#' default non-sequential [future::plan()]. If the output is `TRUE` all functions
#' will behave like they were called with [purrr::map()] and NOT in multisession.
#' ```
#' inherits(future::plan(), "sequential")
#' ```
#' For more information on possible plans please see
#' [the future package Readme](https://github.com/futureverse/future/blob/develop/README.md).

#' [this book chapter](https://rstats.wtf/r-startup.html).
#'
#' ## Get Progress Updates while Functions are Running
#'
#' Most nflfastR functions are able to show progress updates
#' using [progressr::progressor()] if they are turned on before the function is
#' called. There are at least two basic ways to do this by either activating
#' progress updates globally (for the current session) with
#' ```
#' progressr::handlers(global = TRUE)
#' ```
#' or by piping the function call into [progressr::with_progress()]:
#' ```
#' load_pbp(2018:2020) %>%
#'   progressr::with_progress()
#' ```
#'
#' Just like in the previous section, it is possible to activate global
#' progression handlers by default. This can be done by following the below given steps.
#'
#' First, run the following line and the file `.Rprofile` should be opened automatically.
#' If you haven't saved any code yet, this will be an empty file.
#' ```
#' usethis::edit_r_profile()
#'```
#' In the opened file `.Rprofile` add the next line, then save the file and restart your R
#' session. All code in this file will be executed when a new R session starts.
#' The part `if (require("progressr"))` makes sure this will only run if the
#' package progressr is installed to avoid crashing R sessions.
#' ```
#' if (requireNamespace("progressr", quietly = TRUE)) progressr::handlers(global = TRUE)
#' ```
#'
#' After the session is freshly restarted please check if the above method worked
#' by running the next line. If the output is `TRUE` you successfully activated
#' global progression handlers for all sessions.
#' ```
#' progressr::handlers(global = NA)
#' ```
#'
#' For more information how to work with progress handlers please see [progressr::progressr].
