#' Compute Series Conversion Information from Play by Play
#'
#' @description A "Series" begins on a 1st and 10 and each team attempts to either earn
#'   a new 1st down (on offense) or prevent the offense from converting a new
#'   1st down (on defense). Series conversion rate represents how many series
#'   have been either converted to a new 1st down or ended in a touchdown.
#'   This function computes series conversion rates on offense and defense from
#'   nflverse play-by-play data along with other series results.
#'   The function automatically removes series that ended in a QB kneel down.
#'
#' @param pbp Play-by-play data as returned by [`load_pbp()`], [`build_nflfastR_pbp()`], or
#'   [`fast_scraper()`].
#' @param weekly If `TRUE`, returns week-by-week stats, otherwise,
#'   season-by-season stats in argument `pbp`.
#'
#' @return A data frame of series information including the following columns:
#' \describe{
#' \item{season}{The NFL season}
#' \item{team}{NFL team abbreviation}
#' \item{week}{Week if `weekly` is `TRUE`}
#' \item{off_n}{The number of series the offense played (excludes QB kneel
#' downs, kickoffs, extra point/two point conversion attempts, non-plays, and
#' plays that do not list a "posteam")}
#' \item{off_scr}{The rate at which a series ended in either new 1st down or
#' touchdown while the offense was on the field}
#' \item{off_scr_1st}{The rate at which an offense earned a 1st down
#' or scored a touchdown on 1st down}
#' \item{off_scr_2nd}{The rate at which an offense earned a 1st down
#' or scored a touchdown on 2nd down}
#' \item{off_scr_3rd}{The rate at which an offense earned a 1st down
#' or scored a touchdown on 3rd down}
#' \item{off_scr_4th}{The rate at which an offense earned a 1st down
#' or scored a touchdown on 4th down}
#' \item{off_1st}{The rate of series that ended in a new 1st down while the
#' offense was on the field (does not include offensive touchdown)}
#' \item{off_td}{The rate of series that ended in an offensive touchdown while the
#' offense was on the field}
#' \item{off_fg}{The rate of series that ended in a field goal attempt while the
#' offense was on the field}
#' \item{off_punt}{The rate of series that ended in a punt while the
#' offense was on the field}
#' \item{off_to}{The rate of series that ended in a turnover (including on downs), in an
#' opponent score, or at the end of half (or game) while the
#' offense was on the field}
#' \item{def_n}{The number of series the defense played (excludes QB kneel
#' downs, kickoffs, extra point/two point conversion attempts, non-plays, and
#' plays that do not list a "posteam")}
#' \item{def_scr}{The rate at which a series ended in either new 1st down or
#' touchdown while the defense was on the field}
#' \item{def_scr_1st}{The rate at which a defense allowed a
#' 1st down or touchdown on 1st down}
#' \item{def_scr_2nd}{The rate at which a defense allowed a
#' 1st down or touchdown on 2nd down}
#' \item{def_scr_3rd}{The rate at which a defense allowed a
#' 1st down or touchdown on 3rd down}
#' \item{def_scr_4th}{The rate at which a defense allowed a
#' 1st down or touchdown on 4th down}
#' \item{def_1st}{The rate of series that ended in a new 1st down while the
#' defense was on the field (does not include offensive touchdown)}
#' \item{def_td}{The rate of series that ended in an offensive touchdown while the
#' defense was on the field}
#' \item{def_fg}{The rate of series that ended in a field goal attempt while the
#' defense was on the field}
#' \item{def_punt}{The rate of series that ended in a punt while the
#' defense was on the field}
#' \item{def_to}{The rate of series that ended in a turnover (including on downs), in an
#' opponent score, or at the end of half (or game) while the
#' defense was on the field}
