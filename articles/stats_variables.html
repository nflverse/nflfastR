<p>Below you will find a table that lists and explains all the variables
available in <code><a href="../reference/calculate_stats.html">calculate_stats()</a></code>. Compared to the old
<code>calculate_player_stats*()</code> functions that have been
deprecated, practically all variables (and their names) have been
preserved. However, there are a few differences. These are</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>recent_team</code>: renamed to <code>team</code> (recent team
in weekly data never made sense)</li>
<li>
<code>interceptions</code>: renamed to
<code>passing_interceptions</code> (all passing stats have the passing
prefix)</li>
<li>
<code>sacks</code>: renamed to <code>sacks_suffered</code> (to make
clear it’s not on defensive side)</li>
<li>
<code>sack_yards</code>: renamed to <code>sack_yards_lost</code> (to
make clear it’s not on defensive side)</li>
<li>
<code>dakota</code>: not implemented at the moment</li>
<li>
<code>def_tackles</code>: there is <code>def_tackles_solo</code> and
<code>def_tackles_with_assist</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>def_fumble_recovery_own</code>: renamed to
<code>fumble_recovery_own</code> (it is not exclusive to defense)</li>
<li>
<code>def_fumble_recovery_yards_own</code>: renamed to
<code>fumble_recovery_yards_own</code> (it is not exclusive to
defense)</li>
<li>
<code>def_fumble_recovery_opp</code>: renamed to
<code>fumble_recovery_opp</code> (it is not exclusive to defense)</li>
<li>
<code>def_fumble_recovery_yards_opp</code>: renamed to
<code>fumble_recovery_yards_opp</code> (it is not exclusive to
defense)</li>
<li>
<code>def_safety</code>: renamed to <code>def_safeties</code> (we
use plural everywhere)</li>
<li>
<code>def_penalty</code>: renamed to <code>penalties</code> (it is
not exclusive to defense)</li>
<li>
<code>def_penalty_yards</code>: renamed to
<code>penalty_yards</code> (it is not exclusive to defense)</li>
