# A beginner's guide to nflfastR

## Introduction

The following guide will assume you have R installed. I also highly
recommend working in RStudio. If you need help getting those installed
or are unfamiliar with how RStudio is laid out, [please see this section
of Lee Sharpe’s
guide](https://github.com/leesharpe/nfldata/blob/master/RSTUDIO-INTRO.md#r-and-rstudio-introduction).

A quick word if you’re new to programming: all of this is happening in
R. Obviously, you need to install R on your computer to do any of this.
Make sure you save what you’re doing in a script (in RStudio, File –\>
New File –\> R script) so you can save your work and run multiple lines
of code at once. To run code from a script, highlight what you want, and
press control + enter or press the Run button in the top of the editor
(see Lee’s guide). If you don’t highlight anything and press control +
enter, the currently selected line will run. As you go through your R
journey, you might get stuck and have to google a bunch of things, but
that’s totally okay and normal. That’s how I got started!

## Setup

First, you need to install the magic packages. You only need to run this
step once on a given computer. For these you can just type them into the
RStudio console (look for the Console pane in RStudio) directly since
you’re never going to be doing this again.

### Install packages

``` r
install.packages("tidyverse", type = "binary")
install.packages("ggrepel", type = "binary")
install.packages("nflreadr", type = "binary")
install.packages("nflplotR", type = "binary")
```

### Load packages

Okay, now here’s the stuff you’re going to want to start putting into
your R script. The following loads `tidyverse`, which contains a lot of
helper functions for working with data and `ggrepel` for making figures,
along with `nflreadr` (which allows one to quickly download `nflfastR`
data, along with a lot of other data). Finally, `nflplotR` makes
plotting easier.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)
library(nflreadr)
library(nflplotR)
```

This one is optional but makes R prefer not to display numbers in
scientific notation, which I find very annoying:

``` r
options(scipen = 9999)
```

### Load data

This will load the full play by play for the 2019 season (including
playoffs). We’ll get to how to get more seasons later. Note that this is
downloading pre-cleaned data from the nflfastR data repository using the
[`load_pbp()`](https://nflreadr.nflverse.com/reference/load_pbp.html)
function included in `nflreadr`, which is much faster than building pbp
from scratch.

``` r
data <- load_pbp(2019)
```

## Basics: how to look at your data

### Dimensions

Before moving forward, here are a few ways to get a sense of what’s in a
dataframe. We can check the **dim**ensions of the data, and this tells
us that there are `47260` rows (i.e., plays) in the data and `372`
columns (variables):

``` r
dim(data)
#> [1] 47260   372
```

`str` displays the **str**ucture of the dataframe:

``` r
str(data[1:10])
#> nflvrs_d [47,260 × 10] (S3: nflverse_data/tbl_df/tbl/data.table/data.frame)
#>  $ play_id     : num [1:47260] 1 36 51 79 100 121 148 185 214 239 ...
#>  $ game_id     : chr [1:47260] "2019_01_ATL_MIN" "2019_01_ATL_MIN" "2019_01_ATL_MIN" "2019_01_ATL_MIN" ...
#>  $ old_game_id : chr [1:47260] "2019090804" "2019090804" "2019090804" "2019090804" ...
#>  $ home_team   : chr [1:47260] "MIN" "MIN" "MIN" "MIN" ...
#>  $ away_team   : chr [1:47260] "ATL" "ATL" "ATL" "ATL" ...
#>  $ season_type : chr [1:47260] "REG" "REG" "REG" "REG" ...
#>  $ week        : int [1:47260] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
#>  $ posteam     : chr [1:47260] NA "ATL" "ATL" "ATL" ...
#>  $ posteam_type: chr [1:47260] NA "away" "away" "away" ...
#>  $ defteam     : chr [1:47260] NA "MIN" "MIN" "MIN" ...
#>  - attr(*, "nflverse_timestamp")= chr "2025-07-31 14:16:40 EDT"
#>  - attr(*, "nflverse_type")= chr "play by play data"
#>  - attr(*, "nflfastR_version")= chr "5.1.0.9001"
```

In the above, I’ve added in the `[1:10]`, which selects only the first
10 columns, otherwise the list is extremely long (remember from above
that there are `372` columns!). Normally, you would just type
`str(data)`.

You can similarly take a glimpse at your data:

``` r
glimpse(data[1:10])
#> Rows: 47,260
#> Columns: 10
#> $ play_id      <dbl> 1, 36, 51, 79, 100, 121, 148, 185, 214, 239, 255, 277, 29…
#> $ game_id      <chr> "2019_01_ATL_MIN", "2019_01_ATL_MIN", "2019_01_ATL_MIN", …
#> $ old_game_id  <chr> "2019090804", "2019090804", "2019090804", "2019090804", "…
#> $ home_team    <chr> "MIN", "MIN", "MIN", "MIN", "MIN", "MIN", "MIN", "MIN", "…
#> $ away_team    <chr> "ATL", "ATL", "ATL", "ATL", "ATL", "ATL", "ATL", "ATL", "…
#> $ season_type  <chr> "REG", "REG", "REG", "REG", "REG", "REG", "REG", "REG", "…
#> $ week         <int> 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, …
#> $ posteam      <chr> NA, "ATL", "ATL", "ATL", "ATL", "ATL", "MIN", "MIN", "MIN…
#> $ posteam_type <chr> NA, "away", "away", "away", "away", "away", "home", "home…
#> $ defteam      <chr> NA, "MIN", "MIN", "MIN", "MIN", "MIN", "ATL", "ATL", "ATL…
```

Where again I’m only showing the first 10 columns. The usual command
would be `glimpse(data)`.

### Variable names

Another very useful command is to get the `names` of the variables in
the data, which you would get by entering `names(data)` (I won’t show
here because, again, it is `372` columns).

That is a lot to work with!

### Viewer

One more way to look at your data is with the
[`View()`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/View.html) function. If you’re coming
from an Excel background, this will help you feel more at home as a way
to see what’s in the data.

``` r
View(data)
```

This will open the viewer in RStudio in a new panel. Try it out
yourself! Since there are so many columns, the Viewer won’t show them
all. To pick which columns to view, you can **select** some:

``` r
data |>
  select(home_team, away_team, posteam, desc) |>
  View()
```

The `|>` thing lets you pipe together a bunch of different commands. So
we’re taking our data, “`select`”ing a few variables we want to look at,
and then Viewing. Again, I can’t display the results of that here, but
try it out yourself!

### Head + manipulation

To start, let’s just look at the first few rows (the “head”) of the
data.

``` r
data |> 
  select(posteam, defteam, desc, rush, pass) |> 
  head()
#> ── nflverse play by play data ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> ℹ Data updated: 2025-07-31 18:16:40 UTC
#> # A tibble: 6 × 5
#>   posteam defteam desc                                                rush  pass
#>   <chr>   <chr>   <chr>                                              <dbl> <dbl>
#> 1 NA      NA      GAME                                                   0     0
#> 2 ATL     MIN     5-D.Bailey kicks 65 yards from MIN 35 to end zone…     0     0
#> 3 ATL     MIN     (15:00) 2-M.Ryan sacked at ATL 17 for -8 yards (5…     0     1
#> 4 ATL     MIN     (14:20) 24-D.Freeman right tackle to ATL 21 for 4…     1     0
#> 5 ATL     MIN     (13:41) (Shotgun) 2-M.Ryan scrambles left end to …     0     1
#> 6 ATL     MIN     (12:59) 5-M.Bosher punt is BLOCKED by 50-E.Wilson…     0     0
```

A couple things. “`desc`” is the important variable that lists the
description of what happened on the play, and `head` says to show the
first few rows (the “head” of the data). Since this is already sorted by
game, these are the first 6 rows from a week 1 game, ATL @ MIN. To make
code easier to read, people often put each part of a pipe on a new line,
which is useful when working with more complicated functions. We could
run:

``` r
data |> select(posteam, defteam, desc, rush, pass) |> head()
```

And it would return the exact same output as the one written out in
multiple lines, but the code isn’t as easy to read.

We’ve covered `select`, and the next important function to learn is
`filter`, which lets you filter the data to what you want. The following
returns only plays that are run plays and pass plays; i.e., no punts,
kickoffs, field goals, or dead ball penalties (e.g. false starts) where
we don’t know what the attempted play was.

``` r
data |> 
  filter(rush == 1 | pass == 1) |>
  select(posteam, desc, rush, pass, name, passer, rusher, receiver) |> 
  head()
#> ── nflverse play by play data ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> ℹ Data updated: 2025-07-31 18:16:40 UTC
#> # A tibble: 6 × 8
#>   posteam desc                           rush  pass name  passer rusher receiver
#>   <chr>   <chr>                         <dbl> <dbl> <chr> <chr>  <chr>  <chr>   
#> 1 ATL     (15:00) 2-M.Ryan sacked at A…     0     1 M.Ry… M.Ryan NA     NA      
#> 2 ATL     (14:20) 24-D.Freeman right t…     1     0 D.Fr… NA     D.Fre… NA      
#> 3 ATL     (13:41) (Shotgun) 2-M.Ryan s…     0     1 M.Ry… M.Ryan NA     NA      
#> 4 MIN     (12:53) 33-D.Cook right end …     1     0 D.Co… NA     D.Cook NA      
#> 5 MIN     (12:32) 8-K.Cousins pass sho…     0     1 K.Co… K.Cou… NA     D.Cook  
#> 6 MIN     (11:57) 8-K.Cousins pass sho…     0     1 K.Co… K.Cou… NA     A.Thiel…
```

Compared to the first time we did this, the opening line for the start
of the game, the kickoff, and the punt are now gone. Note that if you’re
checking whether a variable is equal to something, we need to use the
double equals sign `==` like above. There’s probably some technical
reason for this \[shrug emoji\]. Also, the character `|` is used for
“or”, and `&` for “and”. So `rush == 1 | pass == 1` means “rush or
pass”.

Note that the `rush`, `pass`, `name`, `passer`, `rusher`, and `receiver`
columns are all `nflfastR` creations, where we have provided these to
make working with the data easier. As we can see above, `passer` is
filled in for all dropbacks (including sacks and scrambles, which also
have `pass` = 1), and `name` is equal to the passer on pass plays and
the rusher on rush plays. Think of this as the primary player involved
on a play.

What if we wanted to view special teams plays? Again, we can use
`filter`:

``` r
data |> 
  filter(special == 1) |>
  select(down, ydstogo, desc) |> 
  head()
#> ── nflverse play by play data ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> ℹ Data updated: 2025-07-31 18:16:40 UTC
#> # A tibble: 6 × 3
#>    down ydstogo desc                                                            
#>   <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>                                                           
#> 1    NA       0 5-D.Bailey kicks 65 yards from MIN 35 to end zone, Touchback.

#> 6    NA       0 5-D.Bailey kicks 65 yards from MIN 35 to end zone, Touchback.
```

Fourth down plays?

``` r
data |> 
  filter(down == 4) |>
  select(down, ydstogo, desc) |> 
  head()
#> ── nflverse play by play data ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> ℹ Data updated: 2025-07-31 18:16:40 UTC
#> # A tibble: 6 × 3
#>    down ydstogo desc

```

Fourth down plays that aren’t special teams plays?

``` r
data |> 
  filter(down == 4 & special == 0) |>
  select(down, ydstogo, desc) |> 
  head()
#> ── nflverse play by play data ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> ℹ Data updated: 2025-07-31 18:16:40 UTC
#> # A tibble: 6 × 3

```

So far, we’ve just been taking a look at the initial dataset we
downloaded, but none of our results are preserved. To save a new
dataframe of just the plays we want, we need to use `<-` to assign a new
dataframe. Let’s save a new dataframe that’s just run plays and pass
plays with non-missing EPA, called `pbp_rp`.

``` r
pbp_rp <- data |>
  filter(rush == 1 | pass == 1, !is.na(epa))
```

In the above, `!is.na(epa)` means to exclude plays with missing (`na`)
EPA. The `!` symbol is often used by computer folk to negate something,
so `is.na(epa)` means “EPA is missing” and `!is.na(epa)` means “EPA is
not missing”, which we have used above.

## Some basic stuff: Part 1

Okay, we have a big dataset where we call dropbacks pass plays and
non-dropbacks rush plays. Now we actually want to, like, do stuff.

### Group by and Summarize

Let’s take a look at how various Cowboys’ running backs fared on run
plays in 2019:

``` r
pbp_rp |>
    filter(posteam == "DAL", rush == 1) |>
    group_by(rusher) |>
    summarize(
      mean_epa = mean(epa), success_rate = mean(success), ypc = mean(yards_gained), plays = n()
      ) |>
    arrange(-mean_epa) |>
    filter(plays > 20)
#> # A tibble: 3 × 5
#>   rusher     mean_epa success_rate   ypc plays
#>   <chr>         <dbl>        <dbl> <dbl> <int>
#> 1 D.Prescott   0.288         0.591  6.41    22
#> 2 T.Pollard   -0.0265        0.456  5.08    90
#> 3 E.Elliott   -0.0412        0.411  4.39   309
```

There’s a lot going on here. We’ve covered `filter` already. The
`group_by` function is an *extremely* useful function that, well, groups
by what you tell it – in this case the rusher. Summarize is useful for
collapsing the data down to a summary of what you’re looking at, and
here, while grouping by player, we’re summarizing the mean of EPA,
success, yardage (a bad rushing stat, but since we’re here), and getting
the number of plays using
[`n()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/context.html), which
returns the number in a group. Unsurprisingly, Prescott was much more
effective as a rusher in 2019 than the running backs, and there was no
meaningful difference between Pollard and Elliott in efficiency.

If you check the [PFR team stats
page](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/dal/2019.htm), you’ll
notice that the above doesn’t match up with the official stats. This is
because `nflfastR` computes EPA and provides player names on plays with
penalties and on two-point conversions. So if wanting to match the
official stats, we need to restrict to `down <= 4` (to excluded
two-point conversions, which have down listed as `NA`) and
`play_type = run` (to exclude penalties, which are
`play_type = no_play`):

``` r
pbp_rp |>
    filter(posteam == "DAL", down <= 4, play_type == 'run') |>
    group_by(rusher) |>
    summarize(
      mean_epa = mean(epa), success_rate = mean(success), ypc=mean(yards_gained), plays=n()
      ) |>
    filter(plays > 20)
#> # A tibble: 3 × 5
#>   rusher     mean_epa success_rate   ypc plays
#>   <chr>         <dbl>        <dbl> <dbl> <int>
#> 1 D.Prescott   0.288         0.591  6.41    22
#> 2 E.Elliott   -0.0185        0.422  4.51   301
#> 3 T.Pollard   -0.0210        0.453  5.29    86
```

Now we exactly match PFR: Zeke has 301 carries at 4.5 yards/carry, and
Pollard has 86 carries for 5.3 yards/carry. Note that we still aren’t
matching Dak’s stats to PFR because the NFL classifies scrambles as rush
attempts and `nflfastR` does not.

### Manipulating columns: mutate, if_else, and case_when

Let’s say we want to make a new column, named `home`, which is equal to
1 if the team with the ball is the home team. Let’s introduce another
extremely useful function, `if_else`:

``` r
pbp_rp |>
  mutate(
    home = if_else(posteam == home_team, 1, 0)
  ) |>
  select(posteam, home_team, home) |>
  head(10)
#> ── nflverse play by play data ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> ℹ Data updated: 2025-07-31 18:16:40 UTC
#> # A tibble: 10 × 3
#>    posteam home_team  home
#>    <chr>   <chr>     <dbl>
#>  1 ATL     MIN           0
#>  2 ATL     MIN           0
#>  3 ATL     MIN           0
#>  4 MIN     MIN           1
#>  5 MIN     MIN           1
#>  6 MIN     MIN           1
#>  7 ATL     MIN           0
#>  8 ATL     MIN           0
#>  9 ATL     MIN           0
#> 10 MIN     MIN           1
```

`mutate` is R’s word for creating a new column (or overwriting an
existing one); in this case, we’ve created a new column called `home`.
The above uses `if_else`, which uses the following pattern: condition
(in this case, `posteam == home_team`), value if condition is true (in
this case, if `posteam == home_team`, it is 1), and value if the
condition is false (0). So we could use this to, for example, look at
average EPA/play by home and road teams:

``` r
pbp_rp |>
  mutate(
    home = if_else(posteam == home_team, 1, 0)
  ) |>
  group_by(home) |>
  summarize(epa = mean(epa))
#> # A tibble: 2 × 2
#>    home     epa
#>   <dbl>   <dbl>
#> 1     0  0.0214
#> 2     1 -0.0154
```

Note that EPA/play is similar for home teams and away teams because
`home` is already built into the `nflfastR` EPA model, so this result is
expected. Actually, away EPA/play is actually somewhat higher,
presumably because away teams out-performed their usual in 2019 as
homefield advantage continues to decline generally.

`if_else` is nice if you’re creating a new column based on a simple
condition. But what if you need to do something more complicated?
`case_when` is a good option. Here’s how it works:

``` r
pbp_rp |>
  filter(!is.na(cp)) |>
  mutate(
    depth = case_when(
      air_yards < 0 ~ "Negative",
      air_yards >= 0 & air_yards < 10 ~ "Short",
      air_yards >= 10 & air_yards < 20 ~ "Medium",
      air_yards >= 20 ~ "Deep"
    )
  ) |>
  group_by(depth) |>
  summarize(cp = mean(cp))
#> # A tibble: 4 × 2
#>   depth       cp
#>   <chr>    <dbl>
#> 1 Deep     0.367
#> 2 Medium   0.573
#> 3 Negative 0.847
#> 4 Short    0.718
```

Note the new syntax for `case_when`: we have condition (for the first
one, air yards less than 0), followed by `~`, followed by assignment
(for the first one, “Negative”). In the above, we created 4 bins based
on air yards and got average completion probability (`cp`) based on the
`nflfastR` model. Unsurprisingly, `cp` is lower the longer downfield a
throw goes.

### A basic figure

Now that we’ve gained some skills at manipulating data, let’s put it to
use by making things. Which teams were the most pass-heavy in the first
half on early downs with win probability between 20 and 80, excluding
the final 2 minutes of the half when everyone is pass-happy?

``` r
schotty <- pbp_rp |>
    filter(wp > .20 & wp < .80 & down <= 2 & qtr <= 2 & half_seconds_remaining > 120) |>
    group_by(posteam) |>
    summarize(mean_pass = mean(pass), plays = n()) |>
    arrange(-mean_pass)
schotty
#> # A tibble: 32 × 3
#>    posteam mean_pass plays
#>    <chr>       <dbl> <int>
#>  1 KC          0.688   388
#>  2 MIA         0.594   288
#>  3 NO          0.585   325
#>  4 LA          0.584   329
#>  5 CHI         0.558   310
#>  6 CLE         0.555   272
#>  7 CAR         0.554   271
#>  8 TB          0.551   321
#>  9 GB          0.550   291
#> 10 ARI         0.548   325
#> # ℹ 22 more rows
```

Again, we’ve already used `filter`, `group_by`, and `summarize`. The new
function we are using here is `arrange`, which sorts the data by the
variable(s) given. The minus sign in front of `mean_pass` means to sort
in descending order.

Let’s make our first figure:

``` r
ggplot(schotty, aes(x=reorder(posteam,-mean_pass), y=mean_pass)) +
        geom_text(aes(label=posteam))
```

![](beginners_guide_files/figure-html/fig1-1.png)

This image is kind of a mess – we still need a title, axis labels, etc –
but gets the point across. We’ll get to that other stuff later. But more
importantly, we made something interesting using `nflfastR` data! The
“reorder” sorts the teams according to pass rate, with the “-” again
saying to do it in descending order. “aes” is short for “aesthetic”,
which is R’s weird way of asking which variables should go on the x and
y axes.

Looking at the figure, the Chiefs will never have playoff success until
they establish the run.

## Loading multiple seasons

Because all the data is stored in the data repository, it is very fast
to load data from multiple seasons.

``` r
pbp <- load_pbp(2015:2019)
```

This loads play-by-play data from the 2015 through 2019 seasons.

Let’s make sure we got it all. By now, you should understand what this
is doing:

``` r
pbp |>
  group_by(season) |>
  summarize(n = n())
#> # A tibble: 5 × 2
#>   season     n
#>    <int> <int>
#> 1   2015 48122
#> 2   2016 47651
#> 3   2017 47245
#> 4   2018 47109
#> 5   2019 47260
```

So each season has about 48,000 plays. Just for fun, let’s look at the
various play types:

``` r
pbp |>
  group_by(play_type) |>
  summarize(n = n())
#> # A tibble: 10 × 2
#>    play_type       n
#>    <chr>       <int>
#>  1 extra_point  6240
#>  2 field_goal   5155
#>  3 kickoff     13613
#>  4 no_play     22752
#>  5 pass        99987
#>  6 punt        12083
#>  7 qb_kneel     2090
#>  8 qb_spike      340
#>  9 run         68128
#> 10 NA           6999
```

## Figures with QB stats

Let’s do some stuff with quarterbacks:

``` r
qbs <- pbp |>
  filter(season_type == "REG", !is.na(epa)) |>
  group_by(id, name) |>
  summarize(
    epa = mean(qb_epa),
    cpoe = mean(cpoe, na.rm = T),
    n_dropbacks = sum(pass),
    n_plays = n(),
    team = last(posteam)
  ) |>
  ungroup() |>
  filter(n_dropbacks > 100 & n_plays > 1000)
#> `summarise()` has grouped output by 'id'. You can override using the `.groups`
#> argument.
```

Lots of new stuff here. First, we’re grouping by `id` and `name` to make
sure we’re getting unique players; i.e., if two players have the same
name (like Javorius Allen and Josh Allen both being J.Allen), we are
also using their id to differentiate them. `qb_epa` is an `nflfastR`
creation that is equal to EPA in all instances except for when a pass is
completed and a fumble is lost, in which case a QB gets “credit” for the
play up to the spot the fumble was lost (making EPA function like
passing yards). The `last` part in the `summarize` comment gets the last
team that a player was observed playing with.

My way of getting a dataset with only quarterbacks without joining to
external roster data is to make sure they hit some number of dropbacks.
In this case, filtering with `n_dropbacks > 100` makes sure we’re only
including quarterbacks. The
[`ungroup()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html) near
the end is good practice after grouping to make sure you don’t get weird
behavior with the data you created down the line.

Let’s make some more figures. The
[`load_teams()`](https://nflreadr.nflverse.com/reference/load_teams.html)
function is provided in the `nflreadr` package, so since we have already
loaded the package, it’s ready to use.

``` r
load_teams()
#> ── nflverse teams data ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> ℹ Data updated: 2025-10-01 08:03:15 UTC
#> # A tibble: 32 × 16

#>  8 CLE       Cleveland Bro…    1050 Browns    AFC       AFC North     #FF3C00   
#>  9 DAL       Dallas Cowboys    1200 Cowboys   NFC       NFC East      #002244   
#> 10 DEN       Denver Broncos    1400 Broncos   AFC       AFC West      #002244   
#> # ℹ 22 more rows
#> # ℹ 9 more variables: team_color2 <chr>, team_color3 <chr>, team_color4 <chr>,
#> #   team_logo_wikipedia <chr>, team_logo_espn <chr>, team_wordmark <chr>,
#> #   team_conference_logo <chr>, team_league_logo <chr>, team_logo_squared <chr>
```

Let’s join this to the `qbs` dataframe we created:

``` r
qbs <- qbs |>
  left_join(load_teams(), by = c('team' = 'team_abbr'))
```

`left_join` means keep all the rows from the left dataframe (the first
one provided, `qbs`), and join those rows to available rows in the other
dataframe. We also need to provide the joining variables, `team` from
`qbs` and `team_abbr` from
[`load_teams()`](https://nflreadr.nflverse.com/reference/load_teams.html).
Why do we have to type `by = c('team' = 'team_abbr')`? Who knows, but
it’s what `left_join` requires as instructions for how to match.

### With team color dots

Now we can make a figure!

``` r
qbs |>
  ggplot(aes(x = cpoe, y = epa)) +
  #horizontal line with mean EPA
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(qbs$epa), color = "red", linetype = "dashed", alpha=0.5) +
  #vertical line with mean CPOE
  geom_vline(xintercept =  mean(qbs$cpoe), color = "red", linetype = "dashed", alpha=0.5) +
  #add points for the QBs with the right colors
  #cex controls point size and alpha the transparency (alpha = 1 is normal)
  geom_point(color = qbs$team_color, cex=qbs$n_plays / 350, alpha = .6) +
  #add names using ggrepel, which tries to make them not overlap
  geom_text_repel(aes(label=name)) +
  #add a smooth line fitting cpoe + epa
  stat_smooth(geom='line', alpha=0.5, se=FALSE, method='lm')+
  #titles and caption
  labs(x = "Completion % above expected (CPOE)",
       y = "EPA per play (passes, rushes, and penalties)",
       title = "Quarterback Efficiency, 2015 - 2019",
       caption = "Data: @nflfastR") +
  #uses the black and white ggplot theme
  theme_bw() +
  #center title with hjust = 0.5
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5, face = "bold")
  ) +
  #make ticks look nice
  #if this doesn't work, `install.packages('scales')`
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10))
```

![](beginners_guide_files/figure-html/fig2-1.png)

This looks complicated, but is just a way of getting a bunch of
different stuff on the same plot: we have lines for averages, dots,
names, etc. I added comments above to explain what is going on, but in
practice for making figures I usually just copy and paste stuff and/or
google what I need.

### With team logos

We could also make the same plot with team logos:

``` r
qbs |>
  ggplot(aes(x = cpoe, y = epa)) +
  #horizontal line with mean EPA
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(qbs$epa), color = "red", linetype = "dashed", alpha=0.5) +
  #vertical line with mean CPOE
  geom_vline(xintercept =  mean(qbs$cpoe), color = "red", linetype = "dashed", alpha=0.5) +
  #add points for the QBs with the logos (this uses nflplotR package)
  geom_nfl_logos(aes(team_abbr = team), width = qbs$n_plays / 45000, alpha = 0.75) +
  #add names using ggrepel, which tries to make them not overlap
  geom_text_repel(aes(label=name)) +
  #add a smooth line fitting cpoe + epa
  stat_smooth(geom='line', alpha=0.5, se=FALSE, method='lm')+
  #titles and caption
  labs(x = "Completion % above expected (CPOE)",
       y = "EPA per play (passes, rushes, and penalties)",
       title = "Quarterback Efficiency, 2015 - 2019",
       caption = "Data: @nflfastR") +
  theme_bw() +
  #center title
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5, face = "bold")
  ) +
  #make ticks look nice
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10))
```

![](beginners_guide_files/figure-html/fig3-1.png)

The only changes we’ve made are to use `geom_nfl_logos` instead of
`geom_point` (how to figure out the right size for the images in the
`width` part? Trial and error).

This figure would look better with fewer players shown, but the point of
this is explaining how to do stuff, so let’s call this good enough.

### Team tiers plot

If it’s helpful, here are a few notes about the [chart originally shown
here](https://www.nflfastr.com/articles/nflfastR.html#example-5-plot-offensive-and-defensive-epa-per-play-for-a-given-season),
which like the above uses nflplotR for team logos.

``` r
library(nflplotR)
# get pbp and filter to regular season rush and pass plays
pbp <- nflreadr::load_pbp(2005) |>
  dplyr::filter(season_type == "REG") |>
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(posteam) & (rush == 1 | pass == 1))
# offense epa
offense <- pbp |>
  dplyr::group_by(team = posteam) |>
  dplyr::summarise(off_epa = mean(epa, na.rm = TRUE))
# defense epa
defense <- pbp |>
  dplyr::group_by(team = defteam) |>
  dplyr::summarise(def_epa = mean(epa, na.rm = TRUE))
# make figure
offense |>
  dplyr::inner_join(defense, by = "team") |>
  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = off_epa, y = def_epa)) +
  # tier lines
  ggplot2::geom_abline(slope = -1.5, intercept = (4:-3)/10, alpha = .2) +
  # nflplotR magic
  nflplotR::geom_mean_lines(aes(y0 = off_epa, x0 = def_epa)) +
  nflplotR::geom_nfl_logos(aes(team_abbr = team), width = 0.07, alpha = 0.7) +
  ggplot2::labs(
    x = "Offense EPA/play",
    y = "Defense EPA/play",
    caption = "Data: @nflfastR",
    title = "2005 NFL Offensive and Defensive EPA per Play"
  ) +
  ggplot2::theme_bw() +
  ggplot2::theme(
    plot.title = ggplot2::element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5, face = "bold")
  ) +
  ggplot2::scale_y_reverse()
```

![](beginners_guide_files/figure-html/ex5-1.png)

- The
  [`geom_mean_lines()`](https://nflplotr.nflverse.com/reference/geom_lines.html)
  function adds mean lines for offensive and defensive EPA per play
- The slope lines are created using
  [`geom_abline()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_abline.html)
- [`scale_y_reverse()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_continuous.html)
  reverses the vertical axis so that up = better defense

Everything else should be comprehensible by now!

### A few more things on plotting

There are two ways to view plots. One is in the RStudio Viewer, which
shows up in RStudio when you plot something. If plots in your RStudio
viewer look ugly and pixelated, you probably need to install the `Cairo`
package and then set that as the default viewer by doing Tools –\>
Global Options –\> General –\> Graphics –\> Backend: Set to Cairo.

The other is to save a .png with your preferred dimensions and
resolution. For example,
`ggsave("test.png", width = 16, height = 9, units = "cm")` would save
the current plot as “`test.png`” with the units specified (you can view
all the ggsave options
[here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsave.html)).

One more note: the RStudio Viewer can take a long time to preview
ggplots, especially if you’re doing things like adding images. If you’re
getting frustrated with a plot taking a long time to display, you can
take advantage of
[ggpreview](https://nflplotr.nflverse.com/reference/ggpreview.html) from
`nflplotR`. To do this, first save the plot to an object and then run
`ggpreview` on it (if this doesn’t make sense, see the examples
[here](https://nflplotr.nflverse.com/reference/ggpreview.html)).

## Real life example: let’s make a win total model

I’m going to try to go through the process of cleaning and joining
multiple data sets to try to get a sense of how I would approach
something like this, step-by-step.

### Get team wins each season

We’re going to cheat a little and take advantage of Lee Sharpe’s famous
`games` file. Most of this stuff has been added into `nflfastR`, but
it’s easier working with this file where each game is one row. If you’re
curious, the triple colon is a way to access what is referred to as
non-exported functions in a package. Think of this as like a secret menu
(why is this secret? Sometimes package developers want to limit the
number of exported functions as to be not overwhelming).

``` r

```

To start, we want to create a dataframe where each row is a team-season
observation, listing how many games they won. There are multiple ways to
do this, but I’m going to just take the home and away results and bind
together. As an example, here’s what the `home` results look like:

``` r
home <- games |>
  filter(game_type == 'REG') |>
  select(season, week, home_team, result) |>
  rename(team = home_team)
home |> head(5)
#> ── nflverse games and schedules ────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> ℹ Data updated: 2025-10-23 14:03:57 UTC
#> # A tibble: 5 × 4
#>   season  week team  result
#>    <int> <int> <chr>  <int>
#> 1   1999     1 ATL       -3
#> 2   1999     1 CHI        3
#> 3   1999     1 CLE      -43
#> 4   1999     1 GB         4
#> 5   1999     1 IND       17
```

Note that we used `rename` to change `home_team` to `team`.

``` r
away <- games |>
  filter(game_type == 'REG') |>
  select(season, week, away_team, result) |>
  rename(team = away_team) |>
  mutate(result = -result)
away |> head(5)
#> ── nflverse games and schedules ────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> ℹ Data updated: 2025-10-23 14:03:57 UTC
#> # A tibble: 5 × 4
#>   season  week team  result
#>    <int> <int> <chr>  <int>
#> 1   1999     1 MIN        3
#> 2   1999     1 KC        -3
#> 3   1999     1 PIT       43
#> 4   1999     1 OAK       -4
#> 5   1999     1 BUF      -17
```

For away teams, we need to flip the result since result is given from
the perspective of the home team. Now let’s make a columns called `win`
based on the result.

``` r
results <- bind_rows(home, away) |>
  arrange(week) |>
  mutate(
    win = case_when(
      result > 0 ~ 1,
      result < 0 ~ 0,
      result == 0 ~ 0.5
    )
  )

results |> filter(season == 2019 & team == 'SEA')
#> ── nflverse games and schedules ────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> ℹ Data updated: 2025-10-23 14:03:57 UTC
#> # A tibble: 16 × 5
#>    season  week team  result   win
#>     <int> <int> <chr>  <int> <dbl>
#>  1   2019     1 SEA        1     1
#>  2   2019     2 SEA        2     1
#>  3   2019     3 SEA       -6     0
#>  4   2019     4 SEA       17     1
#>  5   2019     5 SEA        1     1
#>  6   2019     6 SEA        4     1
#>  7   2019     7 SEA      -14     0
#>  8   2019     8 SEA        7     1
#>  9   2019     9 SEA        6     1
#> 10   2019    10 SEA        3     1
#> 11   2019    12 SEA        8     1
#> 12   2019    13 SEA        7     1
#> 13   2019    14 SEA      -16     0
#> 14   2019    15 SEA        6     1
#> 15   2019    16 SEA      -14     0
#> 16   2019    17 SEA       -5     0
```

Doing the `results |> filter(season == 2019 & team == 'SEA')` part at
the end isn’t actually for saving the data in a new form, but just
making sure the previous step did what I wanted. This is a good habit to
get into: frequently inspect your data and make sure it looks like you
think it should.

Now that we have the dataframe we wanted, we can get team wins by season
easily:

``` r
team_wins <- results |>
  group_by(team, season) |>
  summarize(
    wins = sum(win),
    point_diff = sum(result)) |>
  ungroup()
#> `summarise()` has grouped output by 'team'. You can override using the
#> `.groups` argument.

team_wins |>
  arrange(-wins) |>
  head(5)
#> # A tibble: 5 × 4
#>   team  season  wins point_diff
#>   <chr>  <int> <dbl>      <int>
#> 1 NE      2007    16        315
#> 2 CAR     2015    15        192
#> 3 DET     2024    15        222
#> 4 GB      2011    15        201
#> 5 KC      2024    15         59
```

Again, we’re making sure the data looks like it “should” by checking the
5 seasons with the most wins, and making sure it looks right.

Now that the team-season win and point differential data is ready, we
need to go back to the `nflfastR` data to get EPA/play.

### Get team EPA by season

Let’s start by getting data from every season from the `nflfastR` data
repository:

``` r
pbp <- load_pbp(1999:2019) |>
    filter(rush == 1 | pass == 1, season_type == "REG", !is.na(epa), !is.na(posteam), posteam != "") |>
    select(season, posteam, pass, defteam, epa)
```

I’m being pretty aggressive with dropping rows and columns (`filter` and
`select`) because otherwise loading this all into memory can be painful
on the computer. But this is all we need for what we’re doing. Note that
I’m only keeping regular season games here (`season_type == "REG"`)
since this is how this analysis is usually done.

Now we can get EPA/play on offense and defense. Let’s break it out by
pass and rush too. I don’t remember how to do some of this so let’s do
it in steps. We know we need to group by team, season, and pass, so
there’s the beginning:

``` r
pbp |>
  group_by(posteam, season, pass) |> 
  summarize(epa = mean(epa)) |>
  head(4)
#> `summarise()` has grouped output by 'posteam', 'season'. You can override using
#> the `.groups` argument.
#> # A tibble: 4 × 4
#> # Groups:   posteam, season [2]
#>   posteam season  pass     epa
#>   <chr>    <int> <dbl>   <dbl>
#> 1 ARI       1999     0 -0.226 
#> 2 ARI       1999     1 -0.150 
#> 3 ARI       2000     0 -0.247 
#> 4 ARI       2000     1 -0.0696
```

But this makes two rows per team-season. How to get each team-season on
the same row? `pivot_wider` is what we need:

``` r
pbp |>
  group_by(posteam, season, pass) |> 
  summarize(epa = mean(epa)) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = pass, values_from = epa) |>
  head(4)
#> `summarise()` has grouped output by 'posteam', 'season'. You can override using
#> the `.groups` argument.
#> # A tibble: 4 × 4
#> # Groups:   posteam, season [4]
#>   posteam season    `0`     `1`
#>   <chr>    <int>  <dbl>   <dbl>
#> 1 ARI       1999 -0.226 -0.150 
#> 2 ARI       2000 -0.247 -0.0696
#> 3 ARI       2001 -0.179  0.0727
#> 4 ARI       2002 -0.160 -0.0517
```

This one is hard to wrap my head around so I usually open up the
[reference
page](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_wider.html), read the
example, and pray that what I try works. In this case it did. Hooray!
This turned our two-lines-per-team dataframe into one, with the 0 column
being pass == 0 (run plays) and the 1 column pass == 1.

Now let’s rename to something more sensible and save:

``` r
offense <- pbp |>
  group_by(posteam, season, pass) |> 
  summarize(epa = mean(epa)) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = pass, values_from = epa) |>
  rename(off_pass_epa = `1`, off_rush_epa = `0`)
#> `summarise()` has grouped output by 'posteam', 'season'. You can override using
#> the `.groups` argument.
```

Note that variable names that are numbers need to be surrounded in tick
marks for this to work.

Now we can repeat the same process for defense:

``` r
defense <- pbp |>
  group_by(defteam, season, pass) |> 
  summarize(epa = mean(epa)) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = pass, values_from = epa) |>
  rename(def_pass_epa = `1`, def_rush_epa = `0`)
#> `summarise()` has grouped output by 'defteam', 'season'. You can override using
#> the `.groups` argument.
```

Let’s do another sanity check looking at the top 5 pass offenses and
defenses:

``` r
#top 5 offenses
offense |>
  arrange(-off_pass_epa) |>
  head(5)
#> # A tibble: 5 × 4
#> # Groups:   posteam, season [5]
#>   posteam season off_rush_epa off_pass_epa
#>   <chr>    <int>        <dbl>        <dbl>
#> 1 NE        2007      0.00380        0.422
#> 2 IND       2004     -0.00281        0.412
#> 3 GB        2011     -0.114          0.403
#> 4 KC        2018      0.0209         0.348
#> 5 DEN       2013     -0.0296         0.344

#top 5 defenses
defense |>
  arrange(def_pass_epa) |>
  head(5)
#> # A tibble: 5 × 4
#> # Groups:   defteam, season [5]
#>   defteam season def_rush_epa def_pass_epa
#>   <chr>    <int>        <dbl>        <dbl>
#> 1 TB        2002      -0.0757       -0.290
#> 2 NE        2019      -0.168        -0.241
#> 3 JAX       2017      -0.141        -0.223
#> 4 NYJ       2009      -0.103        -0.221
#> 5 BAL       2008      -0.236        -0.207
```

The top pass defenses (2002 TB, 2017 JAX, 2019 NE) and offenses (2007
Pats, 2004 Colts, 2011 Packers) definitely check out!

### Fix team names and join

Now we’re ready to bind it all together. Actually, let’s make sure all
the team names are ready too.

``` r
team_wins |>
  group_by(team) |>
  summarize(n=n()) |>
  arrange(n)
#> # A tibble: 35 × 2
#>    team      n
#>    <chr> <int>
#>  1 LV        6
#>  2 LAC       9
#>  3 LA       10
#>  4 STL      17
#>  5 SD       18
#>  6 OAK      21
#>  7 HOU      24
#>  8 ARI      27
#>  9 ATL      27
#> 10 BAL      27
#> # ℹ 25 more rows
```

Nope, not yet, we need to fix the Raiders, Rams, and Chargers, which are
LV, LA, and LAC in `nflfastR`.

``` r
team_wins <- team_wins |>
  mutate(
    team = case_when(
      team == 'OAK' ~ 'LV',
      team == 'SD' ~ 'LAC',
      team == 'STL' ~ 'LA',
      TRUE ~ team
    )
  )
```

The `TRUE` statement at the bottom says that if none of the above cases
are found, keep team the same. Let’s make sure this worked:

``` r
team_wins |>
  group_by(team) |>
  summarize(n=n()) |>
  arrange(n)
#> # A tibble: 32 × 2
#>    team      n
#>    <chr> <int>
#>  1 HOU      24
#>  2 ARI      27
#>  3 ATL      27
#>  4 BAL      27
#>  5 BUF      27
#>  6 CAR      27
#>  7 CHI      27
#>  8 CIN      27
#>  9 CLE      27
#> 10 DAL      27
#> # ℹ 22 more rows
```

HOU has 3 fewer seasons because it didn’t exist from 1999 through 2001,
which is fine, and all the other team names have number of seasons that
they should. Okay NOW we can join:

``` r
data <- team_wins |>
  left_join(offense, by = c('team' = 'posteam', 'season')) |>
  left_join(defense, by = c('team' = 'defteam', 'season'))

data |>
  filter(team == 'SEA' & season >= 2012)

#>    team  season  wins point_diff off_rush_epa off_pass_epa def_rush_epa
#>    <chr>  <int> <dbl>      <int>        <dbl>        <dbl>        <dbl>

#>  2 SEA     2013  13          186     -0.101         0.188       -0.128

#>  5 SEA     2016  10.5         62     -0.126         0.102       -0.207 
#>  6 SEA     2017   9           34     -0.192         0.0584      -0.122 
#>  7 SEA     2018  10           81     -0.0273        0.210       -0.130

#>  9 SEA     2020  12           88     NA            NA           NA     
#> 10 SEA     2021   7           29     NA            NA           NA     
#> 11 SEA     2022   9            6     NA            NA           NA     
#> 12 SEA     2023   9          -38     NA            NA           NA     
#> 13 SEA     2024  10            7     NA            NA           NA     
#> 14 SEA     2025  NA           NA     NA            NA           NA     
#> # ℹ 1 more variable: def_pass_epa <dbl>
```

Now we’re getting really close to doing what we want! Next we need to
create new columns for prior year EPA, and let’s do point differential
too.

``` r
data <- data |> 
  arrange(team, season) |>
  group_by(team) |> 
  mutate(
    prior_off_rush_epa = lag(off_rush_epa),
    prior_off_pass_epa = lag(off_pass_epa),
    prior_def_rush_epa = lag(def_rush_epa),
    prior_def_pass_epa = lag(def_pass_epa),
    prior_point_diff = lag(point_diff)
  ) |> 
  ungroup()

data |>
  head(5)
#> # A tibble: 5 × 13
#>   team  season  wins point_diff off_rush_epa off_pass_epa def_rush_epa
#>   <chr>  <int> <dbl>      <int>        <dbl>        <dbl>        <dbl>
#> 1 ARI     1999     6       -137       -0.226      -0.150       -0.0335
#> 2 ARI     2000     3       -233       -0.247      -0.0696       0.0157
#> 3 ARI     2001     7        -48       -0.179       0.0727      -0.0771
#> 4 ARI     2002     5       -155       -0.160      -0.0517      -0.0175
#> 5 ARI     2003     4       -227       -0.234      -0.112       -0.0890
#> # ℹ 6 more variables: def_pass_epa <dbl>, prior_off_rush_epa <dbl>,
#> #   prior_off_pass_epa <dbl>, prior_def_rush_epa <dbl>,
#> #   prior_def_pass_epa <dbl>, prior_point_diff <int>
```

Finally! Now we have the data in place and can start doing things with
it.

We’ve covered `select`, but here we see a new use where a minus sign
de-selects variables (we need to de-select team name for correlation to
work because it doesn’t work for character strings, and correlation with
the season number itself is meaningless). We’ve run the correlation on
this dataframe, removing missing values, and then rounding to 2 digits.
Not surprisingly, we see that wins in the current season are more
strongly related to passing offense EPA than rushing EPA or defense EPA,
and prior offense carries more predictive power than prior defense. Pass
offense is more stable year to year (`0.46`) than rush offense (`0.32`),
pass defense (`0.27`), or rush defense (`0.27`).

I’m actually surprised that the values for passing offense aren’t higher
relative to the others. Maybe it was because most of our prior results
come from the `nflscrapR` era (2009 - 2019)? Let’s check what this looks
like since 2009 relative to earlier seasons:

```

Yep, that seems to be the case. So in the more recent period, passing
offense has become slightly more stable but more predictive of
following-year success, while at the same time rushing offense has
become substantially less stable and less predictive of future team
success.

Now let’s do a basic regression of wins on prior offense and defense
EPA/play. Maybe we should only look at this more recent period to fit
our model since it’s more relevant for 2020. In the real world, we would
be more rigorous about making decisions like this, but let’s proceed
anyway.

``` r
data <- data |> filter(season >= 2009)

fit <- lm(wins ~ prior_off_pass_epa  + prior_off_rush_epa + prior_def_pass_epa + prior_def_rush_epa, data = data)

summary(fit)
#> 
#> Call:
#> lm(formula = wins ~ prior_off_pass_epa + prior_off_rush_epa + 
#>     prior_def_pass_epa + prior_def_rush_epa, data = data)
#> 
#> Residuals:

#> F-statistic: 18.49 on 4 and 379 DF,  p-value: 0.00000000000006782
```

I’m actually pretty surprised passing offense isn’t higher here. How
does this compare to simply using point differential?

``` r
fit2 <- lm(wins ~ prior_point_diff, data = data)

summary(fit2)
#> 
#> Call:
#> lm(formula = wins ~ prior_point_diff, data = data)
#> 
#> Residuals:
#>    Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max 
#> -7.208 -2.052  0.127  2.201  7.324 
#> 
#> Coefficients:

#> (Intercept)       8.12305    0.12512   64.92 <0.0000000000000002 ***
#> prior_point_diff  0.01276    0.00124   10.29 <0.0000000000000002 ***
#> ---
#> Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
#> 
#> Residual standard error: 2.831 on 510 degrees of freedom
#>   (32 observations deleted due to missingness)
#> Multiple R-squared:  0.1718, Adjusted R-squared:  0.1702 
#> F-statistic: 105.8 on 1 and 510 DF,  p-value: < 0.00000000000000022
```

So R2 is somewhat higher for just point differential. This isn’t
surprising as we’ve thrown away special teams plays and haven’t
attempted to make any adjustments for things like fumble luck that we
know can improve EPA’s predictive power.

### Predictions

Now let’s get the predictions from the EPA model:

``` r
preds <- predict(fit, data |> filter(season == 2020)) |>
  #was just a vector, need a tibble to bind
  as_tibble() |>
  #make the column name make sense
  rename(prediction = value) |>
  round(1) |>
  #get names
  bind_cols(
    data |> filter(season == 2020) |> select(team)
  )

preds |>
  arrange(-prediction) |>
  head(5)
#> # A tibble: 5 × 2
#>   prediction team 
#>        <dbl> <chr>
#> 1       11.5 BAL  
#> 2       10.2 SF   
#> 3        9.8 NE   
#> 4        9.6 DAL  
#> 5        9.6 NO
```

This mostly checks out.

What if we just used simple point differential to predict?

``` r
preds2 <- predict(fit2, data |> filter(season == 2020)) |>
  #was just a vector, need a tibble to bind
  as_tibble() %>%
  #make the column name make sense
  rename(prediction = value) %>%
  round(1) %>%
  #get names
  bind_cols(
    data %>% filter(season == 2020) %>% select(team)
  )

preds2 %>%
  arrange(-prediction) %>%
  head(5)
#> # A tibble: 5 × 2
#>   prediction team 
#>        <dbl> <chr>
#> 1       11.3 BAL  
#> 2       10.6 NE   
#> 3       10.3 SF   
#> 4        9.9 KC   
#> 5        9.6 DAL
```

Not surprisingly, this looks pretty similar. These are very basic models
that don’t incorporate schedule, roster changes, etc. For example, a
better model would take into account Tom Brady no longer playing for the
Patriots. But hopefully this has been useful!

## Next Steps

You now should know enough to be able to tackle a great deal of
questions using `nflfastR` data. A good way to build up skills is to
take interesting things you see and try to replicate them (for making
figures, this will also involve a heavy dose of googling stuff).

Looking at others’ code is also a good way to learn. One option is to
look through the `nflfastR` code base, much of which you should now
understand what it’s doing. For example, [here is the function that
cleans up the data and prepares it for later
stages](https://github.com/mrcaseb/nflfastR/blob/master/R/helper_add_nflscrapr_mutations.R):
there’s a heavy dose of `mutate`, `group_by`, `arrange`, `lag`,
`if_else`, and `case_when`.
