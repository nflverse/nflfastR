`nflfastR` is a set of functions to efficiently scrape NFL play-by-play data. `nflfastR` expands upon the features of nflscrapR:
  
* The package contains NFL play-by-play data back to 1999
* As suggested by the package name, it obtains games **much** faster
* Includes completion probability (`cp`), completion percentage over expected (`cpoe`), and expected yards after the catch (`xyac_epa` and `xyac_mean_yardage`) in play-by-play going back to 2006
* Includes drive information, including drive starting position and drive result
* Includes series information, including series number and series success
* Hosts [a repository of play-by-play data going back to 1999](https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-pbp) for very quick access
* Features models for Expected Points, Win Probability, Completion Probability, and Yards After the Catch (see section below)
* Includes a function `update_db()` that creates and updates a database

We owe a debt of gratitude to the original [`nflscrapR`](https://github.com/maksimhorowitz/nflscrapR) team, Maksim Horowitz, Ronald Yurko, and Samuel Ventura, without whose contributions and inspiration this package would not exist.


## Installation

The easiest way to get nflfastR is to install it from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=nflfastR) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("nflfastR")
```

To get a bug fix or to use a feature from the development version, you can install the development version of nflfastR either from [GitHub](https://github.com/nflverse/nflfastR/) with:

``` {r eval = FALSE}
if (!require("pak")) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("nflverse/nflfastR")
```

or prebuilt from the [development repo](https://nflverse.r-universe.dev) with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("nflfastR", repos = c("https://nflverse.r-universe.dev", getOption("repos")))
```

## Usage

We have provided some application examples in the **[Getting Started](https://www.nflfastr.com/articles/nflfastR.html)** article. However, these require a basic knowledge of R. For this reason we have the **[nflfastR beginner's guide](https://www.nflfastr.com/articles/beginners_guide.html)**, which we recommend to all those who are looking for an introduction to nflfastR with R.

You can find column names and descriptions in the **[Field Descriptions](https://www.nflfastr.com/articles/field_descriptions.html)** article, or by accessing the `field_descriptions` dataframe from the package.

## Data access

Even though `nflfastR` is very fast, **we recommend downloading the data from [here](https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases/tag/pbp) or using the `nflreadr` package**. These data sets include play-by-play data of complete seasons going back to 1999 and are updated nightly during the season. The files contain both regular season and postseason data, and one can use game_type or week to figure out which games occurred in the postseason.

## nflfastR models

`nflfastR` uses its own models for Expected Points, Win Probability, Completion Probability, and Expected Yards After the Catch. To read about the models, please see [this post on Open Source Football](https://www.opensourcefootball.com/posts/2020-09-28-nflfastr-ep-wp-and-cp-models/). For a more detailed description of the motivation for Expected Points models, we highly recommend this paper [from the nflscrapR team located here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.00998.pdf). 

Here is a visualization of the Expected Points model by down and yardline.

``` {r epa-model, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = 'hide', fig.keep = 'all', dpi = 600, echo=FALSE, eval = FALSE}

# This code was used to create the ep model image. Since we don't want to include 
# the resulting png file in the package for file size reasons it was uploaded to
# the nflfastR repo and embedded remotely with the next chunk

library(tidyverse)

df <- nflreadr::load_pbp(2014:2019) %>%
        filter(!is.na(posteam) & !is.na(ep), !is.na(down)) %>%
        select(ep, down, yardline_100, air_yards, pass_location, cp)

df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = yardline_100, y = ep, color = as.factor(down))) + 
  geom_smooth(size = 2) + 
  labs(x = "Yards from opponent's end zone",
       y = "Expected points value",
       color = "Down",
       title = "Expected Points by Yardline and Down") +
  theme_bw() + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand=c(0,0), breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(10)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(expand=c(0,0), breaks = seq(from = 5, to = 95, by = 10)) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, hjust = 0.5),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 16, hjust = 0.5),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 18),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 16),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 16),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 16),
    legend.position = c(.90, .80)) +
    annotate("text", x = 14, y = -2.2, size = 3, label = "2014-2019 | Model: @nflfastR")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('man/figures/readme-epa-model-1.png')
```

Here is a visualization of the Completion Probability model by air yards and pass direction.

``` {r cp-model, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = 'hide', fig.keep = 'all', dpi = 600, echo=FALSE, eval = FALSE}

# This code was used to create the cp model image. Since we don't want to include 
# the resulting png file in the package for file size reasons it was uploaded to
# the nflfastR repo and embedded remotely with the next chunk

df %>%
  filter(!is.na(cp), between(air_yards, -5, 45)) %>%
  mutate(pass_middle = if_else(pass_location == "middle", "Yes", "No")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = air_yards, y = cp, color = as.factor(pass_middle))) + 
  geom_smooth(size = 2) + 
  labs(x = "Air yards",
       y = "Expected completion %",
       color = "Pass middle",
       title = "Expected Completion % by Air Yards and Pass Direction") +
  theme_bw() + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand=c(0,0), breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(5)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(expand=c(0,0)) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, hjust = 0.5),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 16, hjust = 0.5),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 18),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 16),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 16),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 16),
    legend.position = c(.80, .80)) +
    annotate("text", x = 2, y = .32, size = 3, label = "2014-2019 | Model: @nflfastR")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('man/figures/readme-cp-model-1.png')
```

`nflfastR` includes two win probability models: one with and one without incorporating the pre-game spread.

* To Timo Riske, Lau Sze Yui, Sean Clement, and Daniel Houston for many helpful discussions regarding the development of the new `nflfastR` models
* To Zach Feldman and Josh Hermsmeyer for many helpful discussions about CPOE models as well as Peter Owen for many helpful suggestions for the CP model
* To Florian Schmitt for the logo design
* The many users who found and reported bugs in `nflfastR` 1.0
